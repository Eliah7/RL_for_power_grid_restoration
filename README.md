# RL For Power Grid Restoration

This repository accompanies the paper Reinforcement Learning for Power Grid Restoration where we do the following:

- We represent the problem of control in Power Grid Systems as a Markov Decision Process.

- We model the Power Grid System as an environment in which different reinforcement learning agents can act.

- We implement a Q-Learning Agent using Deep Neural Networks as the value function approximator, with Graph Neural Networks as a feature extractor since Power Grid Systems are represented using graphs.
